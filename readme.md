## 🚀 What I’m hacking on right now
| Project | TL;DR |
|---------|-------|
| **Web Browsing Agent** | A desktop agent that sees, clicks & types so you don’t have to. Python + OpenCV + GPT function-calling. |
| **Gemini Live-Response Toolkit** | Wrapper around Google Gemini’s streaming API to stop mid-sentence freak-outs. |
| **Dutch-Auction Sim** | A browser-based Dutch auction playground with bot buyers, animated dealers, and price graphs. |
| **Cocoa Autoencoder** | Tiny 🤏 VAE squeezing Cocoapods (and my GPU) just to learn compression math. |

> ⚡ I also keep a drawer full of half-finished experiments: reinforcement-learning bots, Trackmania Wine bottles, Blender physics, and a GPU-powered space heater.
