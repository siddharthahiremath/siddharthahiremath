## 🚀 What I’m hacking on right now

| Project                           | TL;DR                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Browsing Agent**            | Closed‑source desktop agent that sees, clicks & types so you don’t have to — Python + OpenCV + GPT function‑calling. |
| **Jarvis Voice Assistant**        | Always‑on voice bot (`wake‑word` + streaming LLM) that transcribes, thinks, and chats back a la Iron Man.            |
| **Dutch‑Auction Sim**             | A browser‑based auction playground with bot buyers, animated dealers, and price graphs.                              |
| **Image‑Compression Autoencoder** | Unfinished VAE experiment on image compression (learning, not shipping… yet).                                        |

> ⚡ I also keep a drawer full of half‑finished experiments: reinforcement‑learning bots, Trackmania Wine bottles, Blender physics, and a GPU‑powered space heater.

## 🌟 Featured Repos

<!-- Note: Web Browsing Agent is closed‑source, so no public repo link -->

* [`jarvis-voice-assistant`](https://github.com/siddharthahiremath/jarvis-voice-assistant) – Wake‑word, echo‑cancellation, streaming GPT responses. Jarvis, but no suit (yet).
* [`dutch-auction-sim`](https://github.com/siddharthahiremath/dutch-auction-sim) – Game‑theory sandbox built with Node, Vite & too much caffeine.

More public projects coming soon — stay tuned!

Pin your favourites so they float to the top of my profile ⬆️

If you have a bug, an idea, or just want to debate whether automating homework counts as cheating (kidding, Ms. V), hit me up!
